## How the mobile app works ?
### First Activity: List of the last popular films

> When launching the application, the list of the popular films are fetched from the API and displayed into the view.
> You can then slide down to discover the new popular films.

### Second Activity
> On clicking over a film, we can find its name, authors, trailer, actors and its synopsis

## Improvements
> In order to improve this application we could implement:
> + The other calls to the API in the Retrofit contract
> + Improve the first view so it will be like this one:
